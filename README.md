# MEDIAproject
## This repository includes all the intermediate files useful for reproducibility of the analyses performed in the paper "Identification of therapeutic targets in osteoarthritis by combining heterogeneous transcriptional datasets, drug-induced expression profiles, and known drug-target interactions"
## Please explore the [README_gh-pages](https://github.com/ceccarellilab/MEDIAproject/blob/gh-pages/README.md) file for the vignettes.
## Note that for the "Disease-centric" approach we provided the "drug_prioritization.Rmd" file with the code for the workflow.
